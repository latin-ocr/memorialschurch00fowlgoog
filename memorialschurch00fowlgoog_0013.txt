In these Chapter Acts are also several important con-
stitutions ior the regulation oi the staff oi the Minster,
ior some parochial chapelrieS, and for chantries, pro-
testations oi residence made by canons foundations of
chantries, visitations, etc. In 1401 astatute was enacted
ior the obsequies oi King Athelstan and other kingS, .
archbishops oi York, and canons of Ripon, the town
crier was to go round, and ‘the sanctuary men were to
attend at the services. In 1505 the Chapter write to
ung nenry vn offering participandi in au then rengious
offices, and promising special prayers ior his weliare
both in this life andin the liie to come. In 1517 was
executed an indenture ior the making oi a George and
Dragon according to one at Crystall (Kirkstall) Abbey,
registered in Chapter in 1518. In the Chapter Acts are
included also copies oi several wills proved before the
Chapter. These are ior the most part oi the usual kind,
but those oi William de Dalton, Canon, 1371, and oi
William Cawood, another canon, 1419-20, are very long
and most interesting. There is a short extract from
the latter will in “ Test. Ebor.,'' I, 395.

The portion oi a cartulary referred to above extends
from p. 36 to p. 98 in the present volume, and all the
charters entered possess considerable local interest; the
dates ascertained range from 1114 to 1322. Local
research might do much to identiiy the less-known
places mentioned, and the succession oi the tenuras, but
the present editor has no opportunity ior an investigation
oi that description, 'and can only put the matter into an
accessible form, ready ior such as shall hereaiter study
or write upon that portion oi Yorkshire county history
which belongs to Ripon.
